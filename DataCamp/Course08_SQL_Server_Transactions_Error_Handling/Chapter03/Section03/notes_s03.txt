XACT_ABORT & XACT_STATE

Control errors in transactions

XACT_ABORT > will current transaction automatically be rolled back if an error occurs?

SET XACT_ABORT { ON | OFF }    >>> off is the default setting

SET XACT_ABORT OFF;
BEGIN TRAN;
    ...
    RAISERROR();  >> transactions are executed
    THROW ...  >> transactions are not executed
    ...
COMMIT TRAN

XACT_STATE
Returns:
0 > no open transaction
1 > open and commitable transaction
-1 > open and uncommitable transaction (aka doomed transaction)

SET XACT_ABORT OFF;   -- change to one to allow it to remain open and commitable
BEGIN TRY
    BEGIN TRAN;
        ...
        ...
    COMMIT TRAN;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    IF XACT_STATE() = -1
        ROLLBACK TRAN;
    IF XACT_STATE() = 1
        COMMIT TRAN;
    SELECT ERROR_MESSAGE() AS error_message;
END CATCH

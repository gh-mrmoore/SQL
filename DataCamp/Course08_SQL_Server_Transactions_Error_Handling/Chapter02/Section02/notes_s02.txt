THROW

Syntax:
THROW [ error_number, message, state ] [ ; ]

can be invoked without parameters in a CATCH block

BEGIN TRY
    SELECT price/0 FROM orders;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    THROW;
    SELECT 'This line is executed!' AS message;   --line not executed due to divide by zero
END CATCH

--ambiguity

BEGIN TRY
    SELECT price/0 FROM orders;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    SELECT 'This line is executed!' AS message   --no semicolon, THROW becomes an alias
    --with semicolumn, the statement is executed
    THROW;
END CATCH

THROW with parameters
no placeholders, but other functionality available

BEGIN TRY
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM staff WHERE staff_id = 15)
    THROW 51000, 'This is an example', 1;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH

Transaction isolation levels

Concurrency - two transactions with same/similar data executing at the same time

READ COMMITTED (default)
READ UNCOMMITTED
REPEATABLE READ
SERIALIZABLE
SNAPSHOT

SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL 
    { option }

SELECT CASE transaction_isolation_level
    [ cases ]
END AS transaction_isolation_level
FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions
WHERE session_id = @@SPID

READ UNCOMMITTED
least restrictive isolation levels
read rows modified by other transaction without been committed/rolled back

Dirty reads

also allows non-repeatable reads

Summary
> doesn't block other transactions, can be faster
> allows dirty, non-repeatable and phantom reads
> use when concurrency phenomena are okay

relationship types
1-1, 1-many (drawn with rhombus on diagram)

foreign keys point to primary keys of another table

data types must be same, FK must exist in PK (referential integrity)

duplicates and nulls allowed

example:

CREATE TABLE manufacturers (
    name varchar(255) PRIMARY KEY
);

INSERT INTO manufacturers
VALUES ('Ford'), ('VW'), ('GM');

CREATE TABLE cars (
    model varchar(255) PRIMARY KEY
    manufacturer_name integer REFERENCES manufacturers (name)
);

INSERT INTO cars
VALUES ('Ranger', 'Ford'), ('Beetle', 'VW');

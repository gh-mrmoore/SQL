Manipulate Groups of Strings

Introduced 2016-2017 SQL Server

CONCAT(string1, string2 [, stringN])
CONCAT_WS(separator, string1, string2 [, stringN]) - concat with separator

Better than using + because you can do more than strings and it's more reliable

STRING_AGG(expression, separator) [ <order_clause> ]

SELECT
    YEAR(first_vote_date) AS voting_year,
    STRING_AGG(first_name, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY first_name ASC) AS voters  --order clause is optional
FROM voters
GROUP BY YEAR(first_vote_date);

STRING_SPLIT(string, separator) -- opposite of STRING_AGG
result is a table and can only be used in FROM clause

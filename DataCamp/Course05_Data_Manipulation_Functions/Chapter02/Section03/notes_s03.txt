Performing arithmetic operations on dates

add interval, get difference, etc...

DATEADD() - add datepart and get new dates

DATEDIFF() - get difference between two dates.

Can use arithmetic operators, but results can be unreliable...

DECLARE @date1 datetime = '2019-01-01';
DECLARE @date2 datetime = '2020-01-01';

adding and subtracting yields an increase or decrease to the date (end up in 1901 or 21xx as the year)

DATEADD(datepart, number, date)

DATEDIFF(datepart, startdate, enddate) - return an integer from year down to nanosecond

Functions that return system date and time

Common mistakes:

Time is usually in local time zone, but could be UTC as well...

high precision & less exact

higher
SYSDATETIME()
SYSUTCDATETIME()
SYSUTCDATETIMEOFFSET()

less
GETDATE()
GETUTCDATE()
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

use CONVERT() to get date only from date time (watch out for midnight UTC vs midnight local)

ditto time...

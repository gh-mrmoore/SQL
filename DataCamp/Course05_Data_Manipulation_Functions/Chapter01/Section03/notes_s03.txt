Explicit conversion

implicit conversions are not controlled by the user...

Explicit conversion done by CAST() or CONVERT()

CAST(expression AS data_type [(length)])

CONVERT(data_type [(length)], expression [,style])

CAST() is SQL standard, CONVERT() is SQL Server-specific

CONVERT() performs slightly better in SQL Server

SQL vs NoSQL

SQL aka RDBMS

pgSQL, OracleSQL, SQL-Server

Non-relational (NoSQL)
Document-centered, not table-centered

> key-value (redis, manage shopping carts for online purchases)
> document-store (values) MongoDB
> columnar (big data, everything in its own column, Cassandra)
> graph database (NEO 4J based on behaviors)

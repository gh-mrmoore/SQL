Table Partitioning

queries slow as tables grow

partition data to break them up in to smaller pieces...

distribute data over different physical entities

vertical partitioning
split a (normalized) table by column (linked thru shared key)

Horizontal partitioning (split over rows, ie by timestamp)

Declarative partitioning in pgSQL (since 10)

--example
CREATE TABLE sales (
    ...
    timestamp DATE NOT NULL
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (timestamp);

CREATE TABLE sales_2019_q1 PARTITION OF sales
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2019-01-01') TO ('2019-03-01');
--etcetera for other partitions

OLAP and OLTP can benefit, but can also be a challenge

massively parallel processing using shards where different data resides on different machines

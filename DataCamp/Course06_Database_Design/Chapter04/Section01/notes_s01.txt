Database roles and access control

Manage DB access permissions:
Role definition:
> can you login?
> can you create databases?
> can you write to tables?

CREATE ROLE data_analyst;

CREATE ROLE intern WITH PASSWORD 'PasswordForIntern' VALID UNTIL '2020-01-01';

ALTER ROLE admin CREATEROLE;

GRANT and REVOKE privilegse from roles

Roles can be user or group

--create user
CREATE ROLE alex WITH PASSWORD 'PasswordForIntern' VALID UNTIL '2020-01-01';
GRANT data_analyst TO alex;

-- remove user from group
REVOKE data_analyst FROM alex;

Normal forms

> First normal form (1NF)
>> each record must be unique
>> each cell must hold one value

> Second normal form (2NF)
>> satisfies 1NF and...
>> the primary key is one column (automatically meets 2NF)
>> each non-key column must be dependent on all the keys if composite primary key

> Third normal form
>> satisfies 2NF
>> no transitive dependencies: non-key columns can't depend on other non-key columns

> Elementary key normal form (EKNF)
> Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)
> Fourth normal form
> Essential tuple normal form
> Fifth normal form
> Domain-key Normal Form (DKNF)
> Sixth normal form

could have update, insertion or deletion anomalies if we don't normalize enough

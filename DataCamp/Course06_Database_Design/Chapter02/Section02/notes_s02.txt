Normalized and denormalized databases

Normalized data saves space and eliminates data redundancy, but makes for more joins, longer queries and slower performance

Normalization:
    enforces data consistency
    Safer updating, removing and inserting
    Easier to redesign by extending

OLTP typically highly normalized (write-intensive, prioritize quicker and safer insertion of data)
OLAP typically less normalized (read-intensive, prioritize quicker queries for analytics)

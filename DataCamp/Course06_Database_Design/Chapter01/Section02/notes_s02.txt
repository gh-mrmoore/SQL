Storing Data

Structured Data (defined by schemas)
Defined data types & relationships




Unstructured Data
No schemas
Most data (photos, mp3 files, chat logs)



Semi-Structured Data
Self-describing structure 
NoSQL, XML, JSON


Structured data easier to organize and analyze, but can be harder to scale and less flexible


Data Warehouse
> optimized for analytics (OLAP)
> organized for reading and aggregating data 
> usually read-only
> data from multiple sources
> use Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) to speed up processing times
> Denormalized schema, dimensional modeling
>> Data Mart is a subset focusing on a specific item


Data Lake
for storing data of all structures
using object storage, store massive amounts of data cheaply (petabytes)
need to catalog well or it becomes a data swamp
AWS, etc.

ETL or ELT 

Extract-Transform-Load (more traditional)

Extract-Load-Transform has become more common in bigger applications

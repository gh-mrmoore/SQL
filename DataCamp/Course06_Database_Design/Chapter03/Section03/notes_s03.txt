Two types of views

View 
> AKA non-materialized views

Materialized Views store query results on disk, not query
Querying a materialized view means accessing the stored query results
refreshed or rematerialized when prompted or scheduled

Materialized views great if you have long-running queries
Caveat, data can be out-of-date if not refreshed
useful in data warehouses in OLAP

pgSQL:
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW my_mv AS SELECT * FROM existing_table;
and...
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW my_mv;

Materialized views often rely on other materialized views (have to be careful when things refresh)

Creates a dependency chain and may not be efficient to refresh everything at the same time (airflow and luigi can help schedule)

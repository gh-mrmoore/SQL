Database Views

A view is the result set of a stored query on the data.

A virtual table that is not part of the physical schema.

No need to alter table or repear queries....

CREATE VIEW AS
SELECT * FROM ____
....


SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.views;  --see all views, including system views... (POSTGRESQL)

SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.views
WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema');  --exclude system views, POSTGRESQL

Access control, minimal storage for the query, mask query complexity

GRANT privilege(s) _or_ REVOKE privilege(s)
ON object
TO role _or_ FROM role

Privileges: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
Objects: table, view, schema, etc
Roles: database user or group of database users

GRANT UPDATE ON ratings TO PUBLIC;

REVOKE INSERT ON films FROM db_user;

some views can be updated (ie, the tables they're based on can be updated)

UPDATE films SET kind = 'Dramatic' WHERE kind = 'Drama';
doesn't use window or aggregate function

(same for INSERT)
not a good idea to use views for updates

DROP VIEW view_name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ];
RESTRICT returns error if there are objects that depend on the view
CASCADE drops view and any object depending on that view

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS new_query

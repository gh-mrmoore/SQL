Intro to recursion

Recursion - repetitive use of a function, etc, until a set condition is met...

Need a termination condition or you get an infinite repetition

Advantages:
> solve problem if the problem can be broken down in to smaller, similar problems
> code can be easier to read

Disadvantages:
> slower execution time

Sum of Numbers

WITH calculate_SumOfNumbers AS
    ( --Initial Query
    SELECT 1 AS iteration, 1 AS SumOfNumbers
    UNION ALL
    --Recursive section
    SELECT iteration + 1, SumOfNumbers + (iteration + 1)
        FROM calculate_SumOfNumbers
        WHERE iteration < 6
    )
SELECT SumOfNumbers
    FROM calculate_SumOfNumbers;

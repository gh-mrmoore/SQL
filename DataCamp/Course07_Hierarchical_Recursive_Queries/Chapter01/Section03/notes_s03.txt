Solve recursive math problems

Count numbers recursively
number = 1 for iteration = 1,
number = number + 1 for iteration > 1
WITH recursion AS (
    number = 1 -- initial query
    UNION ALL
    number = number + 1  -- recursive query
)
--statement on CTE 
SELECT * FROM recursion;

Calculate sum of potencies
number = 1 for iteration = 1
number = number + iteration^iteration for iteration > 1
WITH recursion AS (
    number = 1  -- initial query
    UNION ALL
    number = number + iteration^iteration  --recursive query 
)
SELECT * FROM recursion;
>> 1 + 2^2 + 3^3 = 14

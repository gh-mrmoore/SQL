Intro to recursive CTE

4 parts:
1) CTE definition
2) Anchor Member
3) Recursive Member
4) Query CTE

WITH cteName AS (
    -- anchor member
    initial Query
    UNION ALL
    -- recursive member
    recursive Query
)
SELECT * FROM cteName

have to specify if more than 200 steps
not allowed to have GROUP BY, HAVING, JOIN(LEFT, RIGHT, OUTER), SELECT DISTINCT, TOP, sub-queries

Anchor and recursive member should have the same number of columns

Working with recursive queries

most common use is to query hierarchical data

>> Get the Hierarchy

WITH hierarchy AS (
    SELECT ID, Supervisor
        FROM employee
        WHERE Supervisor = 0
    UNION ALL
    SELECT emp.ID, emp.Supervisor
        FROM employee emp
    JOIN employeeHierarchy
        ON emp.Supervisor = employeeHierarchy.ID
)
SELECT * from hierarchy;

>> Get the level of the hierarchy
WITH hierarchy AS (
    SELECT ID, Supervisor, 1 AS Level
        FROM employee
        WHERE Supervisor = 0
    UNION ALL
    SELECT emp.ID, emp.Supervisor, LEVEL + 1
        FROM employee emp
    JOIN hierarchy
    ON emp.Supervisor = hierarchy.ID
)
SELECT * FROM hierarchy

>> Combine in to one field

WITH hierarchy AS (
    SELECT ID, Supervisor, CAST('0' AS VARCHAR(MAX)) AS PATH
        FROM employee
        WHERE Supervisor = 0
    UNION ALL
    SELECT emp.ID, emp.Supervisor, PATH + '->' + CAST(emp.Supervisor AS VARCHAR(MAX))
        FROM employee emp
    INNER JOIN hierarchy
    ON emp.Supervisor = hierarchy.ID
)
SELECT * FROM hierarchy

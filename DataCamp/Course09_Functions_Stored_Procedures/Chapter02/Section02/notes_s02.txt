Table-valued UDFs

Inline or multi-statement

Inline:

CREAT FUNCTION SumLocationStats (@StartDate AS datetime = '1/1/2017')
RETURNS TABLE AS RETURN 
SELECT
    PULocationID AS PickupLocation,
    COUNT(ID) AS RideCount,
    SUM(TripDistance) AS TotalTripDistance
FROM YellowTripData
WHERE CAST (PickupDate AS Date) = @StartDate
GROUP BY PULocationID;

table function doesn't require begin/end if it's a single statement

Multi:

CREATE FUNCTION CountTripAvgFareDay (@Month char(2), @Year char(4))
RETURNS @TripCountAvgFare TABLE (
    DropOffDate date, TripCount int, AvgFare numeric
) AS BEGIN INSERT INTO @TripCountAvgFare
SELECT
    CAST(DropOffDate as date),
    COUNT(ID),
    AVG(FareAmount) AS AvgFareAmt
FROM YellowTripData
WHERE
    DATEPART(month, DropOffDate) = @Month
    AND DATEPART(year, DropOffDate) = @Year
GROUP BY CAST(DropOffDate AS date)
RETURN END;

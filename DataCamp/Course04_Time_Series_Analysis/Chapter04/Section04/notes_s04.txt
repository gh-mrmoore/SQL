Maximum levels of overlap

The best result isn't always the most straightforward

Count max people in store at any one time...

SELECT  --break up start and exit time as two different columns
    o.StartTime AS TimeUTC,
    1 AS EntryCount,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY o.StartTime) AS StartOrdinal
FROM #Orders o
UNION ALL
SELECT  o.EndTime AS TimeUTC
    -1 AS EntryCount,
    NULL AS StartOrdinal
FROM #Orders o

>>>Put this in to a CTE

SELECT
    s.TimeUTC,
    s.EntryCount,
    s.StartOrdinal,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY TimeUTC, StartOrdinal) AS StartOrEndOrdinal
FROM StartStopPoints s

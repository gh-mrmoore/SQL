Running totals, moving averages

SELECT
    s.Team,
    s.Game,
    s.RunsScored,
    SUM(s.RunsScored) OVER (
        PARTITION BY s.Team
        ORDER BY s.Game ASC
        RANGE BETWEEN
            UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
            AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS TotalRuns
FROM #Scores s;

Range - range of results
Rows - specify certain number of rows to include

Range duplicates processed all at once (UNBOUNDED or CURRENT ROW)
Rows takes duplicates one row at a time - better for moving average

SELECT
    s.Team,
    s.Game,
    s.RunsScored,
    AVG(s.RunsScored) OVER (
        PARTITION BY s.Team
        ORDER BY s.Game ASC
        ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING
            AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS AvgRuns
FROM #Scores s;

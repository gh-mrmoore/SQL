Building dates

SELECT
    GETDATE() AS DateTime_LTz
    GETUTCDATE() AS DateTime_UTC

SELECT
    SYSDATETIME() AS DateTime2_LTz
    SYSUTCDATETIME() AS DateTime2_UTC

DECLARE
    @SomeDate DATETIME2(3) = '2019-03-01 08:17:19.332';

SELECT YEAR(@SomeDate)

SELECT MONTH(@SomeDate)

SELECT DAY(@SomeDate)

Functions:
SELECT
    DATEPART(Year, @dt) AS TheYear;

SELECT
    DATENAME(MONTH, @dt) AS TheMonth;

Go all the way down to nanoseconds

DATEADD() moves forward or backward

DATEDIFF() compares how much time between two dates

Invalid Dates

"Error safe" date conversion functions

"Unsafe" >> CAST(), CONVERT(), PARSE()
Safer >> TRY_CAST(), TRY_CONVERT(), TRY_PARSE() (SQL Server 2012 and newer)

TRY functions return null if there's an error of some kind, query doesn't crash...
safe functions don't have notable performance impact

Translating date strings

SELECT
    CAST('09/14/99' AS DATE) AS USDate; --fast and ANSI standard

SELECT
    CONVERT(DATETIME2(3),
        'April 4, 2019 11:52:29.998 PM') AS April14  --CONVERT is not an ANSI standard, might stick to CAST

parse can handle locale-specifics

--Germany
SELECT
    PARSE('25 Dezember 2014' AS DATE
        USING 'de-de') AS Weihnachten;  --performs slowly

SET LANGUAGE 'FRENCH'
DECLARE
    @FrenchDate NVARCHAR(30) = N'18 avril 2019',
    @FrenchNumberDate NVARCHAR(30) = N'18/4/2019';

SELECT
    CAST(@FrenchDate AS DATETIME),
    CAST(@FrenchNumberDate AS DATETIME);

the PARSE() function has some difficulty with strings in YYYYMMDD format and will not consistently parse them correctly.

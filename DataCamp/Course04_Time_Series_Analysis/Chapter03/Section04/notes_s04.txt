    t.Day
WITH ROLLUP

FROM Table
GROUP BY
    t.IncidentType,
    t.Office
WITH CUBE
ORDER BY
    t.IncidentType,
    t.Office;

SELECT
    t.IncidentType,
    t.Office,
    SUM(t.Events) AS Events
FROM Table
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS
(
    (t.IncidentType, t.Office),
    ()
)
ORDER BY
    t.IncidentType,

Downsampling and upsampling data

periodicity or grain...

Downsampling - cast datetime to date (courser grain)
SELECT
    CAST(SomeDate AS DATE) AS SomeDate
FROM dbo.SomeTable

SELECT
    DATEADD(HOUR, DATEDIFF(HOUR, 0, SomeDate), 0) AS SomeDate
FROM dbo.SomeTable

upsampling
'disaggregate data' - need an allocatoin rule (how do you allocate hourly data to the minute?)
artificial granularity

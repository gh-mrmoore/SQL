Common window functions

FIRST_VALUE()
LAST_VALUE()
>>>must be ordered...

--example
--Selecte the columns
SELECT SalesPerson, SalesYear, CurrentQuota
    --First value from every window
    FIRST_VALUE(CurrentQuota)
    OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY ModifiedDate) AS StartQuota,
    --Last value from every window
    LAST_VALUE(CurrentQuota)
    OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY ModifiedDate) AS EndQuota,
    ModifiedDate AS ModDate
FROM SaleGoal

LEAD() compare current row to next value
>>>requires use of ORDER BY

--example
SELECT SalesPerson, SalesYear, CurrentQuota
-- Create a window function to get the values from the next row
    LEAD(CurrentQuota)
    OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY ModifiedDate) AS NextQuota,
    ModifiedDate AS ModDate
FROM SaleGoal

LAG()
query value from previous row
>>>requires use of ORDER BY

first value ends up being NULL

--example
SELECT SalesPerson, SalesYear, CurrentQuota
-- Create a window function to get the values from the previous row
    LAG(CurrentQuota)
    OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY ModifiedDate) AS NextQuota,
    ModifiedDate AS ModDate
FROM SaleGoal

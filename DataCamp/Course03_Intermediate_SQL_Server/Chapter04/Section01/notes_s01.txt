process data separately as groups

SELECT SalesPerson, SalesYear, CurrentQuota, ModifiedDate
FROM SaleGoal
WHERE SalesYear = 2011

PARTITION BY creates the frame (if absent, frame is entire table)
arrange using ORDER BY

--example
SELECT SalesPerson, SalesYear, CurrentQuota
    SUM(CurrentQuota)  --can use other aggregations, ie COUNT
    OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear) AS YearlyTotal,
    ModifiedDate AS ModDate
FROM SaleGoal

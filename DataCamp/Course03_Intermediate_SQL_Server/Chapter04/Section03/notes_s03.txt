Increasing window complexity

can add ORDER BY to aggregation windows

--example
SELECT SalesPerson, SalesYear, CurrentQuota
    SUM(CurrentQuota)
    OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY ModifiedDate) AS RunningTotal,
    ModifiedDate AS ModDate
FROM SaleGoal

ROW_NUMBER()
>>requires ORDER BY

--example
SELECT SalesPerson, SalesYear, CurrentQuota,
    ROW_NUMBER()
    OVER (PARTITION BY SalesPerson ORDER BY SalesYear) AS QuotabySalesPerson
FROM SaleGoal

STDEV() calculates standard deviation (for entire table or windows)

--example1
SELECT SalesPerson, SalesYear, CurrentQuota
    STDEV(CurrentQuota)
    OVER () AS StandardDev
    ModifiedDate AS ModDate
FROM SaleGoal

--example2
SELECT SalesPerson, SalesYear, CurrentQuota
    STDEV(CurrentQuota)
    OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY SalesYear) AS StandardDev
    ModifiedDate AS ModDate
FROM SaleGoal


Calculate MODE
>>no function, must use CTE

WITH QuotaCount AS (
SELECT SalesPerson, SalesYear, CurrentQuota,
    ROW_NUMBER()
    OVER (PARTITION BY CurrentQuota ORDER BY CurrentQuota) AS QuotaList
FROM SaleGoal
)
Select * FROM QuotaCount


--continued example
WITH QuotaCount AS (
SELECT SalesPerson, SalesYear, CurrentQuota,
    ROW_NUMBER()
    OVER (PARTITION BY CurrentQuota ORDER BY CurrentQuota) AS QuotaList
FROM SaleGoal
)

Select * FROM QuotaCount
WHERE QuotaList IN (SELECT MAX(QuotaList) FROM QuotaCount)

Common Table Expressions (CTE)

Another type of derived Table

Table defined before you use it, then use it as a Table

--Create a CTE to get the maximum BloodPressureAge by Age
--CTE definitions start with the keyword WITH
-- Followed by the CTE names and the columns it contains
WITH BloodPressureAge(Age, MaxBloodPressure)
AS
--define the CTE query
(SELECT Age, MAX(BloodPressure) AS MaxBloodPressure  --the columns from the definition above
    FROM Kidney
    GROUP BY Age)

SELECT a.Age, MIN(a.BloodPressure), b.MaxBloodPressure
FROM Kidney a
--Join the CTE with the Table
JOIN BloodPressureAge b
    ON a.Age = b.Age
GROUP BY a.Age, b.MaxBloodPressure

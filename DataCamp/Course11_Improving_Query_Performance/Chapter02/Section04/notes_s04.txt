Managing duplicates

use DISTINCT or UNION to remove duplicates

DISTINCT when we only want individual results, but aggreate calculations could require using GROUP BY

UNION can eliminate duplicates from appended queries/joins that would result in duplicates

always use with caution 
may use an internal sorting mechanism that can result in longer query times

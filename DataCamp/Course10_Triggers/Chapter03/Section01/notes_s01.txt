Trigger limitations

Advantages
> database integrity
> enforce business rules directly
> control on which statements are allowed
> complex logic triggered by single event


Disadvantages
> difficult to view and detect
> invisible to client applications (difficult to trace)
> can be hard to follow logic when troubleshooting
> can negatively impact server performance

SELECT * FROM sys.server_triggers; -- finds server-level triggers
SELECT * FROM sys.triggers;  --database and table level triggers

Best Practices
> well-documented database design
> keep trigger designs as simple as possible
> avoid over-use

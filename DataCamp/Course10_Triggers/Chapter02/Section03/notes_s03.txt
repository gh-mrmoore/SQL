DDL triggers

Respond to CREATE, ALTER, DROP

only used AFTER

created at database or server level

no special tables, but can implement user-defined tables for tracking

use FOR keyword instead of AFTER to minimize potential for confusion between DDL and DML triggers

CREATE TRIGGER ___________
ON database
FOR CREATE_TABLE,
    ALTER_TABLE,
    DROP_TABLE
AS
    INSERT INTO ______________ (EventData, ChangeBy)
    VALUES (EVENTDATA(), USER);

can rollback actions:

CREATE TRIGGER ___________
ON DATABASE
FOR DROP_TABLE
AS
    RAISERROR('NO DELETIONS', 16, 1);
    ROLLBACK;

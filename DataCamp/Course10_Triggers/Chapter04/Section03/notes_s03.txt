Troubleshooting Triggers

Tracking trigger executions:

SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_trigger_stats;

Custom solution:
> use trigger definition to update a tracking table for future reference

ID triggers attached to a table...
> query
SELECT name AS TableName
    object_id AS TableID
FROM sys.objects
WHERE name = 'Products';

SELECT o.name AS TableName
        o.object_id AS TableID
        t.name AS TriggerName
        t.object_id AS TriggerID
        t.is_disabled AS IsDisabled 
        t.is_instead_of_trigger AS IsInsteadOf 
FROM sys.objects AS o
INNER JOIN sys.triggers AS t ON t.parent_id = o.object_id 
WHERE o.name = 'Products';
